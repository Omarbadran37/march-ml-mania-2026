# 🏀 March ML Mania 2026 — Community Hackathon

An async community hackathon built on top of [Kaggle's March ML Mania 2026](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/march-machine-learning-mania-2026) competition. Predict the probability of every possible NCAA tournament matchup. The metric is **Brier Score** — lower is better. $50,000 in prizes on the line.

We're running this async, in public, as a team. You don't need to be an ML engineer — just pick a path below and start.

## 🗺️ Three Paths

**🟠 Path A — The Basketball Fan**
Sports fans, bracket fillers, anyone who watches college basketball. Use AI to turn your basketball intuition into data-driven predictions — no coding required.

**🔵 Path B — The Data Explorer**
Spreadsheet users, SQL folks, analysts. Describe what you want and your AI writes the code. You review the output and decide if it makes sense.

**🟢 Path C — The Model Builder**
Engineers, data scientists, Python or R coders who want to go deep. Use an AI coding agent as your co-pilot to build, train, and optimize your own ML pipeline.
